# Last Day At Flock
I was exhausted on last of Flock, because we had boat party on yesterday and there's a lot of walking too. I was honestly tired and arrivied at the venue a bit late. The first session of the was going to ends and it's about time for the second session. But I honesly nothing interesting to attend. However I was so interested in attending "Distgit Implementation in Forgejo" by Tomas Hrcka. So I thought of roaming around catching up with folks, eating some snacks, cakes and some drinks.

## Conversation With A Fellow OG Gamer
{{< figure src="/posts/flock-2025/img/day3/michal.jpg" title="Look what we have here! 👀" caption="Unfortunately, we didn't find any time to play board games though, maybe next time :(" alt="Gamers" >}}

I was talking with Tomas Hrcka and some other CLE folks who were gathered around the table, and I joined them after walking around for a bit. Honestly, I was sleepy because I hadn’t slept well the night before. Some people were talking loudly outside the hotel, and my room was facing the street, so all the noise kept me awake.

Anyway, I remembered [**Michael Konečný**](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/Zlopez) raising his arm during day 1 at Flock 2025’s Bazzite session when someone asked who plays games here. So I started the conversation by asking, “Do you play any games? I saw you raise your hand on day 1 when they asked if anyone here plays games.” We just started chatting, and it was really interesting. Michal plays Warhammer, Elder Scrolls, and more. He’s an OG gamer for sure! I was excited to find someone with similar interests, it’s not something I can expect from my village, where nobody else plays games and I don’t really have gamer friends. To make things even worse, I don’t have any gamer friends either, except for the ones who only play hardcore, toxic multiplayer games. :(

Michal told me he’s played almost all the Elder Scrolls games, and he shared that Elder Scrolls: Morrowind is actually better than the others. Its mechanics are deeper and more complex, with detailed stats that really affect what happens in the game. We talked about that for a while, and it was super interesting. As another Elder Scrolls fan, I found it fascinating and I started wanting to try out Morrowind, even though I’d always avoided older games because I started with Skyrim and thought old games must be less impressive. Turns out, I was wrong, Morrowind might even be better than the rest. The graphics might be outdated, but the gameplay is still awesome.

After a while, [**Jiří Konečný**](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/jkonecny) joined our conversation, and I found out that he's actually [**Michal Konečný**](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/user/Zlopez)'s brother, both working at Red Hat. It was great talking to Jiří; _he's super chill_. We jumped between topics, chatted about language differences, had some technical talk about using custom OSes on mobile phones (including Fairphones), discussed my carrier-locked phone issues, and more.
