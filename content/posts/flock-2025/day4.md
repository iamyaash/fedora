# Day 4 in Prague
## Morning Breakfast

I woke up on time around 9 AM CEST and got ready for breakfast. Since I arrived in Prague, I had been eating at restaurants and the Flock venue, so this was my first time eating at the hotel.

I usually don’t like bread (especially Indian bread), but that day the food counter had a variety of breads and a few side dishes. However, I had already tried Prague’s bread on [**Day 1**](https://iamyaash.github.io/fedora/posts/flock-2025/day1/#end-of-day-1-in-flock) (and it was good), so I decided to give it another go. Honestly, it was very tasty and had a unique flavor that’s not common in Indian breads. It was so good that I could eat it even without any sauce or side dish. I also picked up a few other items from the counter, though I wasn’t sure what they were, but I wanted to try them anyway.

Overall, it was good and light, and I honestly enjoyed it.

## Planning for the Day
I messaged _Ankur Sinha, Michael Konecny, and Justin Wheeler_ during breakfast to ask if they had plans for the day since it was our last day in Prague. Everyone was checking out and preparing to get to the airport on time. I was one of the last to make plans, and since others had already arranged theirs and were staying in different hotels, I decided to join those nearby. It seemed Michael and some CLE folks were planning to visit a museum, so I tagged along with them because they were close to me and I had no plan of my own.

I struggled to buy transportation tickets and asked the hotel receptionist about the nearest train station to buy tickets. I later found out the hotel sold tickets as well, which I hadn’t known, so I ended up spending more than necessary on transportation ever since the day I arrived at Prague. It was frustrating to learn this on the last day, especially since Prague’s transport system is well-implemented, and most stores sell tickets.

Despite this, I bought the tickets and boarded the tram to Václavské náměstí, where the CLE group was waiting for me. 

After some time, I reached Václavské náměstí where Michael was waiting to meet me and lead me to the group. Shortly after, I joined the CLE group members including Fabian Arrotin, Greg Sutcliffe, Michael Konecny, and Akashdeep Dhar. Then we started heading to the movie museum.
## To the Movie Museum

This was my first time visiting a museum, and it was simply amazing. Watching Hollywood movies growing up, experiencing the museum felt like a whole new level. Seeing all the action figures sparked a nostalgic feeling, and I took many photos that bring back those favorite moments every time I look at them.

## To the National Museum
After visting Film Legends museum, we started heading to the Nation Museum which is dedicated for historical collections of the Czech Republic.

But Michael Konecny had to leave our group since his train will be arriving soon, so we went with Michael to the nearby station and sent him off.

Shortly, it started raining fortunately Akashdeep and some other bought umberally but still that was not enough so we had to stop by for few minutes. Then we decided go grab some food, so we went to the nearby KFC and it was my first time eating at KFC too :P

I don't how to order, and the machine is not not working either so Akashdeep helped with that (_honestly without Akashdeep, my trip to Prague would have been a disaster_). I waited in the queue and got my food and sat at my table.

So I was sitting with Greg Sutcliffe, and we started talking and eventually I got to learn that he play [Oxygen Not Included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Not_Included) (ONI). I also play ONI, but it felt a little too hard for me and I was also busy with other works and I can't find time to play that game. After talking with Greg for a while, I got to know that playing ONI is actually a good thing in order to learn automation and I can actually related with that(_with Linux server experiments & automation_). So we started talking more about the games we play on the way to the [Narodni Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_(Prague)).

Eventually we reached the tram station near the museum and we started walking to the museum. Then we got inside, got our ticket/pass and I took the guide books (mistakenly took the Czech language book) for me and Akashdeep as well.

### Camera Museum
At first we started looking into the Camera museum, they had almost all the famous cameras from the old days to the modern cameras as well. They have placed the cameras and they also had a camera booth that explains how the lighting works when taking a photo.

### Bike Museum
After visiting the camera museum, we headed to the bike museum, where there were many bikes on display, including Harley Davidson, Jawa, Praga(_Prague's authentic bikes_), BMW, Norton, and many more. I was tagging along with Fabian and some other folks from Rocky Linux Enterprise.

### Plane Museum
The planes were displayed in the center of the building, hanging from the ceiling and some were placed on ground alongside the vintage cars. There were 19th-century planes, warplanes, helicopters, and more. It brought me so much joy; as a child, I used to play WW2 games and had seen those planes in movies or games. It was such a pleasure to see them in person.

### Car Museum
So, the planes, cars, and bikes were all placed in a single building. The cars were displayed on the ground alongside the planes. There were many different cars, including wooden ones, cars especially used by presidents, VIP cars, and more.

### Astronomy Museum

After finishing the visit to the Cars, Planes, and Bikes museum, we started heading to the Astronomy museum. There, they displayed tools used in astronomy, including very old instruments, vintage electronics used for astronomy, and more.

### Misc
After that, we went inside the electronics museum, where they displayed household electronics used in the 19th century. Everything was household electronics and equipment, arranged according to the era they were used. I recognized some of them; they even existed in India, although they were broken at the time. They displayed items like washing machines, electric stoves, trimmers, and more.

But most of the folks who came with us felt bored looking at the household items museum, so we went to another place, the "civilization" museum (I guess). It showcased different tribes, the tools they used, and many other historical civilization artifacts.

Well, the museum sightseeing has wrapped up, and the group has split into two. One group walked back to the hotel, while the others used public transport. I tagged along with Akashdeep and Sherif and we used public transport. We finally reached the hotel, and I relaxed in Akashdeep's room for a while.

## Dinner with Fedora Folks
{{< figure

    src="/posts/flock-2025/img/day4/dinner/dinner-with-fedora-folks.gif" 
    width="100%"
>}}

Initially, I was planning to join [Justin Wheeler](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jflory7), but it seemed like he was unsure about when they were going to dinner, so I asked the CLE team whether I could join them, and everybody agreed. It even seemed like they had already counted me in, so I decided to go with the CLE folks for dinner. We left [Ibis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fYRn78u8eyzTJ6Rz8) in the evening with the CLE folks. After some time, we eventually reached the restaurant and got a table for us.

I sat near [Akashdeep](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:T0xic0der), [Jonathan](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jdieter), [Aurelian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Abompard), and Fabian. I remembered that I had not received the badge for **Flock 2025** and the **Flock Boat Party**. [Aurelian](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Abompard) helped me get it, and I finally received badges for **Flock 2025** and the **Flock Boat Party**.

{{< figure

    width="100%"

I noticed Akashdeep playing Genshin Impact, so I asked to see his loadouts. He gave me his phone, and I played for a few minutes then I noticed his battery was low, so I returned it.

After dinner, I decided to tag along with Akashdeep. He was going to buy some things, and I thought it would be nice to join him. He visited stores for souvenirs, but nothing interested me as most items were expensive, and I did not want to spend more on cab charges. So, I decided to buy chocolates at Costco.

{{< figure 
    src="/posts/flock-2025/img/day4/dinner/returning.jpg" 
    width="100%"
>}} 
Akashdeep and I were on our way back to the hotel when we saw few people jogging at night, which seemed weird to me. After some walking, Akashdeep and I shared a warm hug goodbye near Costco. We separated, and I entered Costco to buy chocolates.

I bought many and checked out. When I got outside, it was very late. The tram arrived, so I boarded it, reached my room, and set early alarms since I had to get to the airport early.

I eventually slept while watching movies on TV.
