# Day 4 in Prague
## Morning Breakfast

I woke up on time around 9 AM CEST and got ready for breakfast. Since I arrived in Prague, I had been eating at restaurants and the Flock venue, so this was my first time eating at the hotel.

I usually don’t like bread (especially Indian bread), but that day the food counter had a variety of breads and a few side dishes. However, I had already tried Prague’s bread on [**Day 1**](https://iamyaash.github.io/fedora/posts/flock-2025/day1/#end-of-day-1-in-flock) (and it was good), so I decided to give it another go. Honestly, it was very tasty and had a unique flavor that’s not common in Indian breads. It was so good that I could eat it even without any sauce or side dish. I also picked up a few other items from the counter, though I wasn’t sure what they were, but I wanted to try them anyway.

Overall, it was good and light, and I honestly enjoyed it.

## Planning for the Day
I messaged _Ankur Sinha, Michael Konecny, and Justin Wheeler_ during breakfast to ask if they had plans for the day since it was our last day in Prague. Everyone was checking out and preparing to get to the airport on time. I was one of the last to make plans, and since others had already arranged theirs and were staying in different hotels, I decided to join those nearby. It seemed Michael and some CLE folks were planning to visit a museum, so I tagged along with them because they were close to me and I had no plan of my own.

I struggled to buy transportation tickets and asked the hotel receptionist about the nearest train station to buy tickets. I later found out the hotel sold tickets as well, which I hadn’t known, so I ended up spending more than necessary on transportation ever since the day I arrived at Prague. It was frustrating to learn this on the last day, especially since Prague’s transport system is well-implemented, and most stores sell tickets.

Despite this, I bought the tickets and boarded the tram to Václavské náměstí, where the CLE group was waiting for me. 

After some time, I reached Václavské náměstí where Michael was waiting to meet me and lead me to the group. Shortly after, I joined the CLE group members including Fabian Arrotin, Greg Sutcliffe, Michael Konecny, and Akashdeep Dhar. Then we started heading to the movie museum.
## To the Movie Museum

This was my first time visiting a museum, and it was simply amazing. Watching Hollywood movies growing up, experiencing the museum felt like a whole new level. Seeing all the action figures sparked a nostalgic feeling, and I took many photos that bring back those favorite moments every time I look at them.

## To the National Museum
After visting Film Legends museum, we started heading to Narodni Nation Museum which is dedicated for historical collections of the Czech Republic.

But Michael Konecny had to leave our group since his train will be arriving soon, so we went with Michael to the nearby station and sent him off.

Shortly, it started raining fortunately Akashdeep and some other bought umberally but still that was not enough so we had to stop by for few minutes. Then we decided go grab some food, so we went to the nearby KFC and it was my first time eating at KFC too :P

I don't how to order, and my order is not working either so Akashdeep helped with that (_honestly without Akashdeep, my trip to Prague would have been a disaster_). I waited in the queue and got my food and sat at my table.

So I was sitting with Greg Sutcliffe, and we started talking and eventually I got to learn that he play [Oxygen Not Included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Not_Included) (ONI). I also play ONI, but it felt a little too hard for me and I was also busy with other works and I can't find time to play that game. After talking with Greg for a while, I got to know that play ONI is actually a good thing in order to learn automation and I can actually related with that. So we started talking more about the games we play on the way to the [Narodni Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_(Prague))
