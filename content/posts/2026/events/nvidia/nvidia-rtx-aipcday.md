title: 'NVIDIA RTX AI PC Day - 2026'
summary: "Got the opportunity to talk with open-source and Linux enthusiasts. Some college students recognized my Fedora t-shirt and invited me to talk with them. I explained what the Fedora Project is, how they can make the most of open source, and shared some major updates happening in the Fedora Project."
