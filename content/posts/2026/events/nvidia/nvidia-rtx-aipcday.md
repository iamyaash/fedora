# Overview
The NVIDIA RTX AI PC Day in Coimbatore was held on Friday, January 23rd, 2026. The event took place at the CODISSIA Trade Center from 09:30 to 18:30. There's no entry fee and anyone can attend this event. This event served as technological showcase for gamers, creators, and developers to experience next-generation AI powered by NVIDIA's latest RTX 50 series GPUs. They had more than 15,000 registrations.

## Highlight & Activities
### On-spot gaming zones
- Hands-on gaming stations ranging from regular setups to simulations on high-performance gaming with 4k resolutions.
- There was a massive TV at the entrance, and it was the most crowded place I have seen when entering the hall. They showed Ghost of Tsushima, F1, Horizon Zero Dawn and more.
- Also there was specific gaming station for F1 simulator with steering controller setup, and there was huge line standing to experience it.
- They had around more than 20 gaming stations, each showcasing a different areas. From PCs to Laptops.
- Additionally, there was CS2 tournament happened there and that was mirrored on the main huge projector screen.
- Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any chance to play in any setup and I just watched. But I finally found a PC, but they only allowed us to play DOOM: The Dark Ages, and I haven't played it before. So I left.

### AI Demos
-They interactive demos showcasing AI technologies, such as AI generated image using NVIDIA technologies. Some PC where available for showing training AI models, and some showed 3D related aspects. I find the AI demos boring for some reason.

> In simple terms, I haven't gotten any chance to play, and it managed poorly in my opinion. They had frequent breaks, and they haven't informed anyone standing in line to come after some time. I have waited more than 90minutes to play valorant only to find out there was lunch break and they told us to come after 2 hours. I came back again to find out that place being crowded with Creator meetups. Well, at leat I got witness these many high-end & custom built PC and watched some fluid gameplays too.

## Unexpected Meeting with Linux Folks
I was wearing a Fedora Logo T-shirt, my intention was to find Open Source & Linux enthusiasts there, normally seeing Linux folks are rare in Coimbatore but I was fortunate enought to meet college students who are so into Linux & shown passionate interest in Open Source.
